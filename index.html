        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The box model describes how the size and space of an element are determined, including its content, padding, border, and margin.</li>
          <li>Content is the area where the actual text, images, or other media are displayed inside an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want between the content of an element and its border.</li>
          <li>A border defines the line that surrounds the padding and content of an element.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A CSS semantic selector targets elements based on their meaning or role in the HTML structure, like header, nav, or footer.</li>
          <li>A CSS class selector targets elements based on a class attribute, allowing you to apply styles to multiple elements that share the same class.</li>
          <li>A CSS ID selector targets a specific element based on its unique ID attribute, applying styles to that single element.</li>
          <li>A declaration specifies the styling for an element, consisting of a property and its associated value.</li>
          <li>A property defines what aspect of the element you want to style, such as color, font-size, or margin.</li>
          <li>A value specifies the exact style to be applied for a given property, such as red for color, 16px for font-size, or 10px for margin.</li>
          <li>A webpage can be styled using CSS in three ways: by applying inline CSS, by using an internal CSS stylesheet, or by linking to an external CSS stylesheet.</li>
          <li>The class selector declares all the property assignments for the respective class attributes in the linked HTML file.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: ensures that our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.</li>
          <li>The default branch of a repo is called the "main" branch.</li>
          <li>GitHub Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.</li>
          <li>Github projects utilize adaptable spreadsheets, task-boards, and road maps that integrate with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help plan and track your work effectively.</li>
          <li>A pull request is used to merge a comparison branch into the base branch.</li>
          <li>The base branch is where the changes will be merged into.</li>
          <li>Once a pull request is reviewed, accessed and accepted, a branch can be merged into the base branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript: A versatile programming language used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites, allowing developers to build complex web applications and enhance user experiences.</li>
          <li>Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamic language, meaning that variables do not have a fixed type and can hold values of any type. You can change the type of a variable by reassigning it to a value of a different type.</li>
          <li>Weak Typing: JavaScript is a weakly typed language, which allows for automatic type conversion when performing operations with different types. This means that JavaScript may implicitly convert values to the required type, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results or bugs.</li>
          <li>Declarations: Statements in JavaScript that introduce a new variable, function, or other entity. Examples include: var, let, const, and function.</li>
          <li>Properties: Attributes or characteristics of an object. They are defined as key-value pairs and can store data or methods.</li>
          <li>Values: The actual data or content stored in variables, properties, or returned by functions.</li>
          <li>OOP: A programming paradigm called Object-Oriented Programming that organizes code into objects, which combine data and behavior, making it easier to manage, reuse, and scale complex software systems.</li>
          <li>Control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>API (Application Programming Interface): a set of tools and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other, often used to interact with web services.</li>
          <li>querySelector: a method that retrieves the first element in the document that matches a specified CSS selector, enabling you to easily target and manipulate specific elements on a webpage.</li>
          <li>EventListener: a function that waits for and responds to specific events, such as user interactions (clicks, key presses, etc.), allowing you to execute code when that event occurs.</li>
          <li>Variable: a container that stores data values, allowing you to reuse and manipulate that data throughout your code.</li>
          <li>const: a keyword used to declare a variable with a constant value, meaning the variable cannot be reassigned after its initial value is set, although the contents of objects and arrays it points to can still be modified.</li>
          <li>let: a keyword used to declare a block-scoped variable in JavaScript, meaning the variable is only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where it's declared, and its value can be changed after declaration.</li>
          <li>Conditional logic: allows you to execute different code based on whether a specified condition is true or false.</li>
          <li>Data Structure: A method of organizing and storing data in a computer to enable efficient access and modification, allowing for the effective management of data and operations like searching, sorting, and updating. (such as an array)</li>
          <li>Array: a data structure that stores a collection of items, allowing you to access, manipulate, and iterate over those items using an index.</li>
          <li>Array indices: numerical positions that represent the location of each element within an array, starting from 0 for the first element and increasing by 1 for each subsequent element.</li>
          <li>For loop: a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true, allowing you to iterate over arrays or perform repetitive tasks in your code.</li>
          <li>Function: a reusable block of code that performs a specific task, which can be executed by defining and then calling the function’s name and optionally passing in data (arguments) to be used within the function.</li>
          <li>Event: an action or occurrence recognized by JavaScript, such as a user clicking a button, that can be handled by event listeners to trigger specific code.</li>
          <li>Type Coercion: the process by which JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another during operations, like converting a string to a number or vice versa.</li>
          <li>Console (Dev Tools): A tool within a web browser's developer tools that allows you to interact with a webpage's JavaScript by logging messages, running code, and debugging errors in real-time.</li>
          <li>console.log: A JavaScript function used to print messages or data to the browser's console, mainly for debugging purposes.</li>
          <li>Data type: a classification that specifies what kind of data a variable can hold, determining how the data can be used and manipulated in code.</li>
          <strong>Data types include:</strong>
          <li>Primitive values: Basic data types in JavaScript that represent single values and are not objects. They include:</li>
          <li>String: A data type that represents a sequence of characters, used for storing and manipulating text.</li>
          <li>Number: A data type that represents both integer and floating-point numbers, used for mathematical calculations and numerical operations.</li>
          <li>Boolean: A data type that represents a logical value, which can be either true or false, often used for making decisions in code.</li>
          <li>Object: A data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs, used to store and organize related data and functionality.</li>
          <li>Array: A data type that represents a list-like collection of values, which can be accessed by their index position and can hold multiple data types.</li>
          <li>BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision. Example: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n</li>
          <li>Undefined: A data type that represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value, indicating the absence of a value.</li>
          <li>Null: A data type that represents the intentional absence of any object value, used to explicitly indicate that a variable has no value.</li>
          <li>Symbol: A data type that represents a unique and immutable value, often used as a key for object properties to ensure uniqueness.</li>
