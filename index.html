          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains metadata that the browser uses for proper rendering.</li>
          <li>The "meta" and "title" elements are examples of elements that are used within the head element.</li>
          <li>The "meta" element contains attributes such as "charset" for character encoding or "viewport" for screen size dimensions and scaling.</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title of the document, and is displayed in the page's tab. </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The box model describes how the size and space of an element are determined, including its content, padding, border, and margin.</li>
          <li>Content is the area where the actual text, images, or other media are displayed inside an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want between the content of an element and its border.</li>
          <li>A border defines the line that surrounds the padding and content of an element.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A CSS semantic selector targets elements based on their meaning or role in the HTML structure, like header, nav, or footer.</li>
          <li>A CSS class selector targets elements based on a class attribute, allowing you to apply styles to multiple elements that share the same class.</li>
          <li>A CSS ID selector targets a specific element based on its unique ID attribute, applying styles to that single element.</li>
          <li>A declaration specifies the styling for an element, consisting of a property and its associated value.</li>
          <li>A property defines what aspect of the element you want to style, such as color, font-size, or margin.</li>
          <li>A value specifies the exact style to be applied for a given property, such as red for color, 16px for font-size, or 10px for margin.</li>
          <li>A webpage can be styled using CSS in three ways: by applying inline CSS, by using an internal CSS stylesheet, or by linking to an external CSS stylesheet.</li>
          <li>The class selector declares all the property assignments for the respective class attributes in the linked HTML file.</li>

          <li>The default branch of a repo is called the "main" branch.</li>
          <li>GitHub Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.</li>
          <li>Github projects utilize adaptable spreadsheets, task-boards, and road maps that integrate with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help plan and track your work effectively.</li>
          <li>A pull request is used to merge a comparison branch into the base branch.</li>
          <li>The base branch is where the changes will be merged into.</li>
          <li>Once a pull request is reviewed, accessed and accepted, a branch can be merged into the base branch.</li>
